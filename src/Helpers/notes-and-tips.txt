****INTERVIEW QUESTIONS*****

declarative - you just say map through this array but you don't tell the machine how to do item
JSX won't allow loops - imperative functions.  Declarative functions like Map, Find are allowed - because they return something - map and "for of loop" returns an array


imperative - using for of array where you include instructions to tell the machine what to do
